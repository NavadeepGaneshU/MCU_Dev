<b>[x] Special concerns to be taken while using TI CCS on MSP430 (specially with Assembly codes)</b>\

1] First time debugging will take forever! Please hold on. If this process is interrupted, project file is going to be ruined.\
2] Never have special characters or blank spaces in project directory path or name.\
3] Concerns have been raised that having WinAVR installed in your PC may cause debugging issues in MSP430 (Assembly code specifically)\
P.S - I had the same issue and spent hours together unit finally found someone saying this over TI forum.
